### Follow up questions

- Discuss "Should align with Harbor" & "Adding webex specific components".
  Specific examples:
  - GlobalSearchInput: <https://momentum-design.github.io/momentum-react-v2/?path=/story/momentum-ui-globalsearchinput--example>
  - Avatar with Presence Types: <https://momentum-design.github.io/momentum-react-v2/?path=/story/momentum-ui-avatar--presence-types>
  - NavigationTab: <https://momentum-design.github.io/momentum-react-v2/?path=/story/momentum-ui-navigationtab--example>
  - Dialpad: <https://www.figma.com/file/vdL18BATeJAIq2JvGAjRPD/Components---Web-Application?node-id=9386%3A812&t=q64yNqzuc7KDOvkA-4>

- Is Harbor ok with us sharing the core components (develop, maintain and own them)?
  - There needs to be a very well defined line between what a shared component primitive (for all 3 design systems) is and the rest of application-specific components (charts for Magnetic, dialpad for Momentum etc).

- @Karthik - would u mind sharing a proposal on the "editing components"?

- If our teams goal is to deliver to a certain timeline and the harbor team has their own timeline / roadmap, how will clashes, disagreement in terms of priority be handled?
  - How fast can we make changes in Harbor?

- @Karthik - would it be possible to share Harbor roadmap in this meeting as well?

- We can provide more information on what "component tokens" mean and the purpose.

- Go over the Component Matrix together

  - How are we going to approach documentation together? Weâ€™d like a single source of truth for all our end products (dev tooling (token-builder), design docs(tokens, branding, philosophies etc,) , component docs (engineering + design) , component migration guidelines, etc).
